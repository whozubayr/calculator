# calculator
A calculator program using Tkinter allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations through a graphical user interface with buttons for numerical digits and operations, as well as a display field for input and results. The program is created by importing the Tkinter library, designing the layout with widgets such as buttons and a display field, and writing event handling functions to specify the behavior of the calculator when buttons are pressed. The main loop is then run to start the GUI and enable user interaction.
